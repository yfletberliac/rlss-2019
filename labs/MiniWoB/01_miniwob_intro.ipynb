    "\n",
    "The core idea is to create a set of browser-based tasks to be solved using RL methods. Every task is a small dynamic webpage, which could be interacted using a mouse or keyboard. The reward is given for executing correct sequence of actions. Description of the goal is included into the webpage.\n",

As VNC is a cross-platform protocol used by humans to communicate with remote GUI applications, RL agent also achieves this ability (is RL agent smart enough to communicate is a different question). \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start looking at actual MiniWoB action and observation spaces, we need to state one quite important difference between OpenAI Gym and OpenAI Universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gym API is **synchronous** in terms of agent's calls to `step()` function and internal environment state. For example, if the agent playing Atari decided to download the 10GB model file (between calls to `step()`), Atari 2600 emulator and the game it emulates notice nothing, as Atari knows nothing about wall clock time, only about ticks of 6507 MCU and internal emulated hardware state. Gym can do this, because it has the full control over every environment it exposes to the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Universe has much less knowledge and control over the software it communicates with. VNC protocol provides remote framebuffer interface (low-level name of VNC protocol is RFB), capturing the image on the remote machine and transferring it to VNC client running in front of you. Your actions, like mouse movements and key presses are recorded and being sent to the VNC server. So, VNC is relatively thin protocol providing the impression that remote applications are running locally. This simplifies application integration, but at the same time if you've missed same frame from the input images stream, you've missed it. So, Universe Gym API is **asynchronous**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* agent needs to be fast enough to process observations and keep the desired framerate. This might be important in cases when something qick is happening on the screen\n",
    "* on `reset()` call, environment takes some time to start producing observations. To indicate this transient states, it returns None for observations, which means you need to wait and repeat the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is in native support of several environments running in parallel. On creation of environment you can specify how many of them need to be created and system will start several docker images running in parallel. Alternatively, you can provide several ports of already running docker images (possibly on remote machines in the cloud). As a result, Universe `Env` instance returns vectors of observations from `reset()` and `step()` calls and expects you to provide vector of actions for `step()`. This breaks the API, but simplifies the development. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is yet another API difference (quite a lot for Gym API with 3 methods!): reset of the environment is performed automatically, so there is no reason to call `reset()` on VNC env. The only way to distinguish end of episode is by the flag returned by `step()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ptan library supports both vectorized and old-style environments, which also makes your life a little bit easier. "
